## ✨ What Makes This Rappi Clone Different

Most ride-hailing scripts stop at "search a car and pay." This platform ships with the features that actually run a ride-hailing *business*:

- **Smart Bidding (InDrive-style)** — riders name their fare, drivers counter-offer, lowest accepted price wins — same negotiation engine that beat Uber in 15 countries
- **Multi-Service Vehicle Modes** — out of the box: bike, auto, car, premium, SUV, parcel, rental — toggle modes from a single driver app, not five separate builds
- **Sub-Second Dispatch** — geo-sharded dispatch engine with sub-1s matching on 100k+ concurrent drivers, validated on production loads
- **Driver Supply Heatmaps** — live heatmap of online drivers vs ride demand by zone, so ops teams can rebalance supply before surge pricing kicks in
- **Three-Sided Wallet** — rider pays, driver earns, platform takes commission — all settled inside one ledger with full GST/VAT-ready reports

## 📦 Core Features

**Rider:** search & fare estimate · book ride · live map tracking · pay in-app · rate driver · ride history · scheduled rides · multi-stop · share trip · safety toolkit

**Driver:** go online · accept/decline trips · turn-by-turn nav · earnings dashboard · daily payouts · performance metrics · document upload · support chat

**Admin:** driver KYC · fare & commission rules · surge zones · dispute resolution · payouts · analytics · promo codes · fleet management
